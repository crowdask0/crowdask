A question and answer site for academics, librarians and students. This system is further developed and deeply customized for the purpose of academic sharing based on Question2Answer (https://github.com/q2a/question2answer). It has its own CAS login, user control policies (automatic), badge rules and many other new features. We also integrate all these new features into an installation scripts. So you can install this system as simply as Question2Answer.
